		<h2>Dear Bash,</h2>
		<p>Let’s make this clear. This is not a love letter, but rather a declaration of your lack of communication. You think you’re so cool, with your trendy abbreviations and personalized color schemes. All the advanced coders seem to swoon after you, leaving Fetch broken and forgotten. Every move command you require just reminds me of how controlling you are. Control-a this, control-e that. Move to the top, move to the bottom. Why can’t I just move as I please? Present working directory, or pwd, just looks like “password”, yet another mind-fuck. Change directory is the only straight-forward line you read, with a simple cd, was that so hard? No. I guess I can learn to love you, because if you love someone you learn to love their quirks and understand how they love. Bash, your utilization of keyboard shortcuts and symbols is quite witty. If I feel lost, a simple cd~ takes me back to home, ls creates a list of folders. As we create new directories with mkdir, perhaps our love can grow.</p>
